# DndPartyTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.
I only intend for this tool to help me track my DnD groups stats as they play a new campaign.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
